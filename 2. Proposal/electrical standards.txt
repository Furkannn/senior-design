Other Miscellaneous Standards

	Employers should use ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCI's) on all 120-volt, single-phase, and 15- and 20-ampere receptacles.
		The ground-fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI, is a fast-acting circuit breaker designed to shut off electric power in the event of a ground-fault and prevent injury to the worker.
	With the ground wire disconnected, the chassis leakage is limited to 100 uA and the patient lead leakage must not exceed 50 uA.
